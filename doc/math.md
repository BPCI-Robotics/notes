Formulae:

The relation between force, acceleration, and mass is like this:

`a = Δv / Δt`
If the car has a `0-100` of `2.5 seconds`, what is its acceleration?
`a = (100 km/h)/(2.5 s) = 40 km/h/s` of acceleration.

`v = Δs / Δt`
If the car travelled `10 meters` in `2 seconds`, how fast is it?
`v = (10 m)/(2 s) = 5 m/s` of speed.

`F = ma`
If someone has pushed me (`100 kg`) on the ice to `2 m/s` in one second, I have experienced:
`a = (2 m/s)/(1 s) = 2 m/s/s`
`F = (100 kg)(2 m/s/s) = 200 N` of force.


`a = F/m`
If someone exerts `200 N` of force on me (`100 kg`), I will accelerate by:
`a = (200 N)/(100 kg) = 2 m/s/s` of acceleration.


`m = F/a`
If I accelerate by `2 m/s each second` due to a force of `200 N`, I weigh:
`m = (200 N)/(2 m/s/s) = 100 kg` of mass.


`s = s0 + vΔt`
If I am `2 meters` away from home, and I travel `2 m/s` for `2 seconds`, I am:
`s = (2 m) + (2 m/s)(2 s) = 6` m away from home.


`s = s0 + v0Δt + (1/2)aΔt^2`
If I am `200 m` off the ground, I am falling due to gravity (`-9.8 m/s/s`), and I am not falling initially (`0 m/s`),
How far would I be off the ground in `2 seconds`?
`s = (200 m) + (0 m/s)(2 s) + (1/2)(-9.8 m/s/s)(2 s)^2`
`= 180.4 m` off the ground.


`v = v0 + aΔt`
I am at a stop (`0 m/s`) and my car can go to `20 m/s` in `4 seconds`. How fast will I go in `one second`?
`a = (20 m/s)/(4 s) = 5 m/s/s`
`v = (0 m/s) + (5 m/s/s)(1 s) = 5 m/s` of velocity.


Where `Δ` should be read as "change in".


`C = πd = 2πr`
This circle has a radius of `2 m`, so it has a diameter of `4 m` and a circumference of about `12.6 m`.


`P = 2πωT`
My motor has a torque of `1 Nm` at `200 rpm`, what is its power consumption?
`ω = (200 rpm)/60 = 3.3 rps`
`P = 2π(1 Nm)(3.3 rps) = 20.73 W` of power.


`ω = Δθ/Δt`
My motor makes a `full rotation` each `second`. What is its rpm?
`ω = (1 revolution)/(1 s) = 1 rps = 60 rpm`.


`v = ωC`
My wheels rotate at `200 rpm` and have a circumference of `31 cm`. How fast is the robot?
`ω = (200 rpm)/60 = 3.3 rps`
`v = (3.3 rps)(0.31 m) = 1.02 m/s` of speed.


This relates energy to power and time:

`E = Pt`
The motor used `12 watts` for `20 seconds`, how much energy did it use?
`E = (12 W)(20 s) = 240 J` of energy.


`t = E/P`
The battery has a capacity of `50400 joules`. My motors use `48 W`. How long will it last?
`t = (50400 J)/(48 W) = 1050 s` of time.


`P = E/t`
What is the power consumption of my motors if they finished the battery (`50400 J`) in `1050 seconds`?
`P = (50400 J)/(1050 s) = 48 W` of power.
